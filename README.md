# Ift_6390_Kaggle_Handwrittendigit

This code repo was build as a part of the kaggle competition 1 Classification of handwritten digits for IFT 6390 Machine Learning course. The goal of this project is to implement and train classification algorithms. 

The Notebook Kaggle_Competition-LR_Scratch requires numpy, pandas and matplotlib libraries to run and it has the implementation of Logistic Regression from scratch.

The Notebook Kaggle_Competiton_CNN requires numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, keras and sklearn libraries to run.

The train data(train.csv) , train Result(train_result.csv) and test data(test.csv) must be uploaded should be present in same directory as notebook files.

After this you can run this Jupyter notebook.

A test_result.csv file would be generated that can be uploaded to the Kaggle Competition.
